## Open and navigate

`Super+Space` opens the compact search prompt. Start typing, click a tab, use
Tab / Shift+Tab to cycle, or Ctrl+1…5 to select a visible tab by position.
Switching tabs preserves the query. Arrow keys select a result; Enter activates
it. Esc clears the query, then closes the menu; Left or Backspace on an empty
query goes back a level in System.

| Tab | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| **All** | Answers followed by Apps, System, Files and Folders sections, up to five results per section |
| **Apps** | Installed applications; Ctrl+G switches between list and grid and saves the choice |
| **System** | Omarchy actions in two panes: categories on the left, their items on the right |
| **Files** | File name search under your home directory, with type, sort and result-limit controls |
| **Folders** | Folder search, including a separate System folders filter for configuration directories |

The System tab keeps the category list visible while you browse its items.
Use Up/Down to select, Right or Enter to open, and Left to go back. Typing
searches the menu tree; a query can name the whole path, so `update omarchy`
selects Update › Omarchy. Ctrl+Up/Down jumps between matches. If no system
entry matches, the tab shows instant answers such as the calculator.

![System categories and actions](docs/media/system.png)

`Super+Alt+Space` opens Apps directly. Existing routes such as
`omarchy menu summon style.theme` open the corresponding System submenu.
External select/input prompts (emoji, timezone, keybindings and other dmenu
consumers) retain their plain prompt without launcher tabs.

## Files and folders

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Open the selected path with its default application. Files that would run or install rather than open (`.desktop`, AppImage, scripts, installers and packages, or anything with the executable bit) open their folder instead |
| Alt+Enter | Open its containing folder |
| Ctrl+C | Copy the path |
| Ctrl+T | Open a terminal in the folder |
| Ctrl+F | Cycle the type filter |
| Ctrl+R | Cycle where to look: everywhere, home, or one search root (with search roots) |
| Ctrl+S | Cycle the sort order |
| Ctrl+L | Cycle the displayed result limit |

Files filters: All files, Documents, Images, Videos, Audio and Code.
Folders filters: Folders and System folders. Sort by relevance, newest, oldest,
name A–Z or name Z–A; display limits are 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200.

Search uses `fd`, excludes package caches, virtual environments, Git internals
and Steam/Wine traversal noise, and collects up to 500 candidates. It searches
names and paths, not file contents. System folders include browser configuration
roots while skipping their cache and profile internals. All starts file searches
at two characters and skips them when an instant answer already handles the
query. Late results keep the selection on the same item where possible.

### Search roots (NAS, cloud drives, other disks)

Besides your home folder, Files, Folders and All can search other folders:
a NAS share, a cloud drive, a second disk. Omni does not connect anything
itself; a root is a folder that is already mounted, by whatever means you
use (`fstab`, `rclone mount`, `sshfs`, GVFS through the file manager).

Add one from the bar popup: **Settings › Search roots › Add folder…** opens
your file manager's folder chooser (through the desktop portal; `zenity` if
there is none). Each root shows its path, file system and source, free space
and index state, and takes these keys:

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Switch the root on or off |
| `←`/`→` | Live search, or an index rebuilt every 15 min, 1 h, 6 h or 1 day |
| `r` | Rebuild the index now |
| `x`, `x` | Remove the root and its index |

- **Live** runs `fd` over the root as you type, like the home search, in a
  separate lane: local results appear at once and the root's are added when
  they arrive.
- **Index** lists the root in the background into
  `~/.cache/omarchy-menu-omni/roots/` and searches that list, which is instant
  even on a slow share. A network file system (NFS, SMB, rclone, sshfs) is added
  with an hourly index; a local disk is added live.
- A root that does not answer within two seconds counts as offline: live
  search skips it, and an indexed root still shows results, marked
  *offline*.
- Results carry the root's label, e.g. `NAS › Photos/2024`. In Files and
  Folders a third chip row picks where to look: **Everywhere**, **Home** or
  one root (click it, or Ctrl+R to cycle). All always searches everywhere.

Roots are stored in `state.json`, so they can also be edited by hand:

```json
"searchRoots": [
  { "path": "/mnt/nas/home", "label": "NAS", "enabled": true, "cacheMinutes": 60 },
  { "path": "/mnt/GoogleDrive", "label": "Drive", "enabled": true, "cacheMinutes": 360 }
]
```

`cacheMinutes: 0` is live. Paths must be absolute; `~/` is expanded.

### zoxide

With [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) installed, folders you
visit often rank higher among equal matches, and so do files in them
(`"zoxide": "rank"`, the default). `"results"` also adds the folders zoxide
knows to Folders and All even where `fd` did not look, and `"off"` ignores
zoxide. Folders opened from the launcher (Enter, Alt+Enter, Ctrl+T) are
recorded as visits (`"zoxideAdd": true`), so `z` in a terminal learns from it
too. Both are in the bar popup under **Zoxide**.

## Tab order and visibility

Settings are read on every open from
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy-menu-omni/state.json`, defaulting to
`~/.local/state/omarchy-menu-omni/state.json`:

```json
{
  "appsView": "grid",
  "tabOrder": ["all", "apps", "system", "files", "folders"],
  "allSections": ["apps", "system", "files", "folders"],
  "disabledTabs": [],
  "allSectionsOff": [],
  "cursorStyle": "block",
  "cursorBlink": true,
  "cursorWhenEmpty": true,
  "commandsWithoutSlash": true,
  "searchRoots": [],
  "zoxide": "rank",
  "zoxideAdd": true
}
```

The initial application view is `list`; the example selects `grid`.
`cursorStyle` sets the search cursor: `block` (default), `beam`, `underline`,
`outline` or `none`; `cursorBlink: false` keeps it solid, and
`cursorWhenEmpty: false` hides it until something is typed.
`commandsWithoutSlash: false` makes answers (math, conversions, generators,
`shell`, `kill`, `ai`…) work only after `/`; plain text is then purely a search.
`tabOrder` controls visible tab order and the Ctrl+number shortcuts.
`allSections` independently controls the order of result sections in All.
Unknown or duplicate IDs are ignored; omitted IDs are appended in default order.

To hide file and folder search, set `"disabledTabs": ["files", "folders"]`.
Their sections also disappear from All and its file searches stop. To keep the
tabs but leave sections out of All's search, list them in `allSectionsOff`
instead, e.g. `["files", "folders"]`; any section may be off. To open Apps
by default, disable All and put Apps first in `tabOrder`. Disabling every tab
is ignored so the launcher remains usable.

Direct routes remain available: opening Apps or a System submenu temporarily
shows that active tab even when disabled. Switching away hides it again.
Unknown settings are preserved when Ctrl+G saves the view. Invalid JSON is left
untouched; fix its syntax and reopen the menu.

## Bar button and settings

Omni ships an optional bar widget, **Omarchy Menu Omni** (the Omarchy logo).
Add it to the bar with the bar's widget picker, or put
`{ "id": "omarchy-menu-omni" }` first in `bar.layout.left` of
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`.

- **Right click** opens the launcher, the same as `Super+Space`.
- **Left click** opens a popup (Settings › Bar button swaps the two clicks,
  saved as `"barLeftClick": "menu"` in `state.json`) with the System actions. Its **Settings** row
  (Enter or `→`) unfolds the option groups below; each group opens on its own
(Enter or `→`, `←` closes), and several can be open at once:
  - **Bar button**: which click opens the popup and which the launcher.
  - **Launcher**: apps view, cursor style, cursor blink, cursor in an empty
    field, answers without `/`.
  - **Tabs**: switch each tab on or off, and change their order.
  - **Search in All**: switch each result section on or off, and change
    their order. A section that is off leaves All only, its tab stays
    (`allSectionsOff` in `state.json`).
  - **Look**: the `style.json` geometry.
  - **Search roots**: folders searched besides your home, and how
    (see [Search roots](#search-roots-nas-cloud-drives-other-disks)).
  - **Zoxide**: ranking by visited folders, and learning from the launcher.
  - **AI**: agent, plus the model and effort for that agent.
  - **Settings folder**: opens `~/.local/state/omarchy-menu-omni/`.
- The **System** actions below it are always shown: every action of the
  System submenu (screensaver, lock, suspend, hibernate, logout, reboot,
  shutdown), including your own entries from `omarchy-menu.jsonc`.

Keys in the popup:

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑`/`↓` | Move |
| `←`/`→` | Change a value or move a tab or section |
| `Enter` | Toggle or run |
| `Esc` | Close |

The mouse works too: the `‹` and `›` arrows change a value, and a click toggles
or runs.

Changes are written to `state.json`, `style.json` and `ai.json`. Other keys in
those files, unknown ones included, are kept. The launcher picks the changes up the
next time it opens. A file that is not valid JSON is shown as such and left
untouched.

## Screenshots

[Browse the gallery](docs/media/README.md) for the All search, file results,
System search, calculator and AI agent selector. The demo above shows the All search, Apps grid, the
System tree and its search, file search, calculator, unit conversion and an AI
answer.

## Instant answers

| Example | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sqrt(144)+2^8` | Calculator: 268 |
| `100 km to miles` | Unit conversion |
| `20 c to f` | Temperature conversion |
| `123 eur to usd` | Currency conversion with rate date |
| `time in tokyo` | Local time and offset |
| `uuid`, `password 24`, `epoch` | Generated values; Ctrl+R refreshes them |
| `sha256 omarchy`, `base64 hello` | Developer utilities |
| `github.com/basecamp/omarchy` | Open a URL |
| `kill chromium` | Matching apps, one row each with its helper processes counted in (a process whose parent has the same name belongs to it); Ctrl+E lists every process. Enter sends SIGTERM to the one listed, checked by pid and start time |
| `shell ping sme.sk` | Enter runs the command in a new terminal, which stays open afterwards |

Start a query with `/` for answers only: `/2+3`, `/100 km to miles`,
`/password`, `/shell ls` or `/ai …` show just the answer, without apps, files
or menu entries around it, and the tabs are hidden. A lone `/` lists one
example per command as a read-only hint; typing narrows the hints to the
commands that still fit (`/pa` → `/password 24`) and they give way to the
answer once it is unambiguous. Without the slash
the same text is a normal search with any answer on top.

Unmatched text offers web search. Chromium-family browsers use their configured
search engine; Firefox uses the fallback template (DuckDuckGo by default).
Calculator and unit conversions work locally. Currency queries fetch and cache
rates only when used. See [all syntax and limitations](docs/answers.md).

## AI answers

Type `ai <question>` and press Enter to submit. The answer streams into the
menu; Ctrl+C copies it, arrow/Page keys scroll, and Esc cancels or closes.
After an answer is ready, Enter continues the conversation in a terminal.
Typing alone sends no request.

![AI agent selector](docs/media/ai.png)

In AI mode the tab bar lists the installed agents instead of the tabs
(Claude, Codex, Pi — whichever CLIs are on `PATH`; Pi also runs local
models). One is always
preselected, so Enter asks straight away; Tab / Shift+Tab or Ctrl+1…n switches
agent, handy when one has run out of usage. Switching cancels a running
answer, and the last pick is remembered in `state.json` as `aiAgent`.

Before anything has been picked (or if the remembered agent is uninstalled),
the preselected agent is `~/.config/omarchy/defaults/agent`, else the first
installed one.

Per-agent settings live in `~/.local/state/omarchy-menu-omni/ai.json`, next to
`state.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {"claude": "haiku", "codex": "gpt-6-luna", "pi": "openai-codex/gpt-6-luna"},
  "efforts": {"claude": "low", "codex": "low", "pi": "low"}
}
```

By default every agent runs on the model and effort its own CLI is configured
with; the plugin picks nothing. `models` and `efforts` (both optional) set a
model or reasoning effort per agent for launcher questions — for example a
cheap, fast model as above. Codex launcher questions skip `config.toml` (see
below), so without an entry here they use Codex's built-in default model.
Continuing in the terminal resumes on the CLI's own model.

A question still running after `maxRunSeconds` (default 300, 10–3600) is
stopped and shown as timed out.

For compatibility with omarchy-find's `ai.json`, two older keys still work: an
`"agent"` overrides the Omarchy default for the first-run preselection only
(a remembered pick always wins), and a top-level `"model"` pins that agent's
model, including in the terminal continuation. `models` covers both needs.

Install and authenticate the chosen CLI separately.

| Agent | Restrictions during the menu request |
| --- | --- |
| Claude | WebSearch and WebFetch only, strict empty MCP configuration, restricted mode |
| Codex | Read-only sandbox and hosted web search. No MCP servers, account connectors (apps), plugins, browser or computer use, hooks, memories or image generation (`--ignore-user-config`, `mcp_servers={}`, `--disable …`) |
| Pi | No tools, extensions or skills |
| Antigravity (agy) | Disabled: its headless run cannot be kept away from its MCP servers and plugins |
| OpenCode | Disabled: tool removal cannot be enforced by this adapter |

The agent's output is bounded before it reaches the shell: a small Perl relay
between the CLI and the menu drops any output line over 1 MiB (terminated or
not), stops the agent after 16 MiB of output, and caps stderr at 16 KiB per line
and 256 KiB in total. The menu keeps at most 512 KiB of answer text.

The terminal continuation uses your ordinary interactive permissions. Markdown
images render as links, raw HTML is escaped, and only clicked HTTP(S) links open.
The adapter implementation and tests are in `ai/` and `tests/ai_unit_test.js`.

## Installation and integration

Requires **Omarchy Quattro** with its Quickshell plugin API.

### Install

The [Omarchy plugin marketplace](https://plugins.omarchy.org) uses the standard
Omarchy Git installer:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/filip-spaldon/omarchy-menu.git --enable
```

The installer validates the plugin, places it in
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/omarchy-menu-omni`, and enables it. Enabling Omni
replaces the stock menu while keeping existing `Super+Space`, `Super+Alt+Space`
and `omarchy menu` routes. It also provides an optional bar button, see
[Bar button and settings](#bar-button-and-settings). Verify with:

```bash
omarchy menu ping
omarchy menu summon
```

Custom system actions still come from
`~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc`.

### Update, disable and remove

```bash
omarchy plugin update omarchy-menu-omni
omarchy plugin disable omarchy-menu-omni
omarchy plugin enable omarchy-menu-omni
omarchy plugin remove omarchy-menu-omni
```

Run the command for the action you need. Disabling or removing Omni restores
the stock menu when it was active before Omni was enabled. To explicitly select
the stock menu, run `omarchy plugin enable omarchy.menu`.

Removal deletes the plugin checkout. Preferences and `ai.json` under
`~/.local/state/omarchy-menu-omni/` and the currency cache are retained.

### Dependencies and runtime behavior

Omni uses the existing Omarchy shell and its menu, browser and application
helpers. File search requires `fd`; clipboard actions use `wl-copy` / `wl-paste`
(`wl-clipboard`); opening paths uses `gio` (`glib2`); terminals use
`xdg-terminal-exec`. Other helpers are Bash, GNU coreutils, `ps` (`procps-ng`),
`timedatectl` (`systemd`), `curl`, `jq`, `gtk-launch`, `uwsm-app`, `findmnt` and
`flock` (`util-linux`). These are normally provided by Omarchy. The folder
chooser for search roots uses the desktop portal through `python-gobject`
(an Omarchy base package), or `zenity`; zoxide is optional. AI additionally needs a supported agent CLI and
its authentication; see [AI answers](#ai-answers).

There is no custom installer, remote build or additional service. The plugin
runs inside the existing shell with your user permissions. It reads menu
configuration, installed applications and file names beneath your home directory
and the search roots you added; preferences, cached exchange rates and root
indexes are written to the paths documented above. It never mounts or logs in
to anything.
Currency queries access the rate service, AI submission starts the chosen agent,
and opening a URL or web search launches your browser. System actions retain the
usual Omarchy behavior, including permission prompts where required.

### Existing local installations

When migrating from `filippaldo.menu`, close the menu, rename the plugin directory,
replace its ID in `shell.json` (including `cloneSourceRestores`), and move the old
state directory to `omarchy-menu-omni` under the same state root. Keep existing
settings; an `ai.json` from the old plugin directory moves to the state
directory too. Rescan plugins after the move.

## Appearance and development

The card follows the active Omarchy theme. Its size lives in
`~/.local/state/omarchy-menu-omni/style.json`, created on first open with the
defaults and re-read every time the menu opens:

```json
{
  "fontScale": 1,
  "cardWidth": 560,
  "bodyHeight": 0.6,
  "fixedHeight": false,
  "top": 0.2,
  "pickerHeight": 0.7
}
```

The defaults keep the stock menu's full-size text and a results area that fits
its rows, but are wide enough for the tabs to sit on one line and pinned near
the top so the card grows downward. The stock menu itself is
`{"cardWidth": 300, "bodyHeight": 0.7, "top": "center"}`.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fontScale` | `1` | Text and icon scaling (0.5–2) |
| `cardWidth` | `560` | Width in `Style.space()` units (200–2000); chips wrap when narrow |
| `bodyHeight` | `0.6` | Results area as a share of the screen height |
| `fixedHeight` | `false` | `false` fits the rows; `true` keeps one size while typing and switching tabs |
| `top` | `0.2` | `"center"`, or the top edge as a share of the screen |
| `pickerHeight` | `0.7` | Maximum list height of dmenu pickers |

Missing or out-of-range values fall back to the defaults above. Some combinations
to try:

| Look | fontScale | cardWidth | bodyHeight | fixedHeight | top |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compact | 0.8 | 540 | 0.35 | true | 0.22 |
| Spotlight | 0.9 | 720 | 0.40 | true | 0.15 |
| Dense | 0.75 | 680 | 0.55 | true | 0.12 |
| Comfortable | 1.0 | 640 | 0.38 | true | 0.20 |

The empty All prompt is always compact. Source edits usually reload
automatically; after adding or renaming a file run `omarchy restart shell`.

### Card shader

The card can run a compiled Qt shader (`.qsb`) as its background, behind
the rows and text.
The setting is read from three places; the first one that is set wins:

| Source | Key | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `style.json` | `"shader"` | `"none"`, or a path: `~/…`, absolute, or relative to `~/.config/omarchy/` |
| `~/.config/omarchy/shell.toml` | `[menu] shader` | the same values |
| the theme's `shell.toml` | `[menu] shader` | a plain `name.qsb` in the theme folder, used only with `"themeShaders": true` in `style.json` |

Settings › Look › **Shader** cycles Default (unset here), None and every
`.qsb` in `~/.config/omarchy/shaders/`; **Theme shaders** switches the theme
source on. Theme shaders are off by default: installed themes come from other
people's repositories, and a heavy shader slows the whole desktop, not just
the menu.

Before the card loads a file it is checked: opened without following
symlinks, a regular file owned by you or root, at most 1 MiB. A refused,
missing or broken shader leaves the plain card and logs one warning. A file
recompiled in place is picked up on the next open.

Shaders get `source` (the card's background shape), `resolution` (texels), `time` (seconds the
card has been open; it stops while the menu is closed), `accent`,
`foreground` and `background`. Compile with `qsb` from `qt6-shadertools`,
which Omarchy does not install:

```bash
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qsb --glsl "100 es,120,150" --hlsl 50 --msl 12 -o my.frag.qsb my.frag
```

Qt compiles for GLSL ES 100 and 120 too, which have no integer bit
operations, `uint` or `fwidth`. The card texture is premultiplied, so scale
anything a shader adds by the source alpha to keep the corners transparent.
The shader renders at one texel per point and is scaled up, and `time`
advances at 12 fps while the menu is open (about 4.6% of a core on the test
VM); a static shader costs next to nothing.

### Code layout

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Menu.qml` | Entry point: tabs, routing, row model, keys and the card's layout |
| `CardShader.qml` | The card shader: effect, load-error fallback, reload revision and the open-only clock; `SettingsStore.qml` vets its file |
| `AnswerEngine.qml` | Instant answers (calculator, conversions, time, generators, kill, URL, shell, web search) and the data they fetch |
| `FileSearchController.qml` | Files/Folders search: `fd`/`stat` processes over $HOME and the search roots, root status and background indexing, zoxide scores, results and ranking into rows |
| `AiController.qml` | AI mode: config, agent discovery and switching, generation processes, terminal handoff |
| `SettingsStore.qml` | Loads, validates and saves `state.json` and `style.json` |
| `BarWidget.qml` | Bar button: left click shows the settings popup and System actions, right click opens the launcher |
| `AiPanel.qml`, `ResultRow.qml`, `SystemCategoryItem.qml`, `AppGrid.qml`, `TabBar.qml` | Visual pieces of the card |
| `MenuModel.js`, `Tabs.js`, `FileSearch.js`, `Roots.js`, `Settings.js`, `ai/*.js` | Pure logic, tested with Node |

The controllers own no UI and reach the menu only through their `menu`
property.

```bash
node tests/menu_unit_test.js
node tests/ai_unit_test.js
```

[Development and integration notes](docs/development.md) describe the inherited
menu behavior, application fallback and test boundaries.
